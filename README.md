# SimpleJSON
SimpleJSON is a wide, feature-extensive JSON/[GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) library which aims on simplifying loads of JSON operations, which makes dealing with JSON a *piece of cake*.

# Features
* Extremely easy to use
* Easily read, write and handle JSON from any file or URL, using a basic reader, a basic configuration or a complex configuration.
* Different JSON utilities for simplifying building JSON.
* Clean, easy-to-read and heavily-documented code.
* Built to be thread-safe. This library supports running in multi-threaded environments.
* Outstanding performance and very fast.

# Using the library
As for now, you can access the built library from [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON). It may be deployed to a Maven repository in the future.

The library is configured to produce javadoc and sources JARs. This should allow you to browse JavaDocs from your project directly.

# Download
If your project does not use a build system like Maven or Gradle, then you should consider adding [JAR files](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/releases/) to your classpath instead.

# Examples
For examples, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/tree/master/src/main/java/examples) package.

# Contributing
